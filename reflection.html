                    Responsive design defines as the flexibility around grids and layouts of different devices and platforms. 
                    There are vast amounts of different screen size and platforms that exist throughout technology. 
                    The changes that are made through using computers to mobile devices are drastic and the layouts and elements
                     of websites have to be matched to proper size depending on devices. 
                
                    Having a single layout for a website leads to uncomfortable situations while using the website. 
                    Requiring user friendly environment is one of the main components to designing a website. C
                    ompatibility and utility should be considered to give comfort and ease to website users.
                    Web pages can take advantage of this to be on different platforms and devices in different sizes and format.

                    The way I have implemented responsive design was to choose two different sizes for the layout styles of the website.
                     I tried several approaches and changes to width to match its resolution and uses. I used a 414 px max-width for iphone 8 to
                    be able to check if the changes were made completely due to my device being a iphone 8.
                     In addition, I have designed images to fit mobile screens so that certain amounts can be displayed. 
                     Other components such as fonts, elements, size were considered to make changes. The problem I have faced was making 
                     the navigation bar appropriate, so I decreased the paddings and margins but couldn’t find the best fit to make it more 
                     user friendly. It was very challenging to figure out way to fit responsive design and have failed at some components due
                      to lack of knowledge. Lastly, I have a sidebar that can successfully re-arrange layout at responsive design.

                    Through this assignment, I have learned to design websites and implement responsive design and host it using 
                    static hosting solution so it can be viewed online. Also, finding the right size and space for images and elements 
                    didn’t seem that difficult at beginning but created the most problem to deal with. Through this assignment, 
                    I have learned that nothing is easy and more effort is needed in creating a solid and good website.
